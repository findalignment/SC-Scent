## Scent Advice

2. Test fragrances on your skin—body chemistry matters!
3. Try our Scent Search tool to filter by notes and preferences
4. Start with samples before committing to a full bottle

### What's the difference between EDP, EDT, and Parfum?
- **Parfum**: Highest concentration (20-30%), longest lasting
- **EDP (Eau de Parfum)**: 15-20%, lasts 6-8 hours
- **EDT (Eau de Toilette)**: 5-15%, lighter, lasts 3-5 hours
- **EDC (Eau de Cologne)**: 2-4%, very light, 2-3 hours

### How should I apply fragrance?
- Apply to pulse points (wrists, neck, behind ears)
- Don't rub—let it dry naturally
- Apply to moisturized skin for better longevity
- Less is more—2-3 sprays is plenty
